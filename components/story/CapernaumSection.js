          Capernaum is an ancient town on the coast of the Sea of Galilee in
          Israel. The word Capharnaum is derived from this cities name and
          means a "disorderly accumulation of objects". This town is very
          closely related to the ministry of Jesus Christ and was a place
          where He brought peace and love among the chaos. We want to change
          our Capernaum during this time of the Coronavirus by spreading love
          and peace just like Jesus did. We fully believe that together we can
          activate more compassion, action, and purpose.
